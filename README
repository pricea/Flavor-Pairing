Note: this is isn't finished yet. It works kind of the way I want it to, but it
isn't efficient at all.

Little Python program to suggest new flavor pairings, given what the user says
they already like.
Uses a text file of flavor pairs the user likes together, in the following
form:

flavorX - flavorY
flavorA - flavorB
etc...

The program prompts the user to enter a flavor, and based on the text file
guesses what flavors they might like paired with the one they entered. The
algorithm is based on this simple idea: if you say you like apple and
cranberry together and cranberry and almond together, that probably makes you
more likely to like apple and almond together.
